From Association of Computing Machinery Cyber x AI Lab Fall 2024.

Implemented an FGSM adversarial attack in PyTorch by training a CNN and generating imperceptibly perturbed inputs that caused controlled misclassification, strengthening understanding of ML model vulnerabilities and adversarial-robust defense.

Project-structure:  
cnn-cifar10.py (Convolutional neural networks with CIFAR-10 dataset)  
fgsm.py (Fast Gradient Sign Attack)

Here is a batching visualization from running the code on Google Colab.
